Project Task: Aloha-frontpage re-creation

# Project Overview:
This is the first course project for Wed Development Full-Stack class 2019, which includes three files: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.Although the outcome is still very primitive, I have learnt a lot through this learing process as someone who had no previous knowledge in any of above areas. 
Through crearting the HTML file: I have learnt to creat a HTML file, the basic concepts, and some important syntax of HTML. I also learnt to link HTML to other files, such as CSS file and Javascript,  
Through creating the CSS file: I have learnt some important CSS concepts, syntaxs, and how to style the webpage using various methods. I used Flickity plug-in for the slides required. I have gained a better understanding of responsive web design. 
Throught creating the Javascript file, I have ganined a better understanding of the relationship between Javcascript and CSS, and HTML. I experiented with some basic syntax of functions in the file.
